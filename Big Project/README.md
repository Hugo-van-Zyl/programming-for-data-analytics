# Programming for Data Analytics - Sunshine Data Analysis Project
by Hugo van Zyl

# Overview
This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook that analyses historical sunshine data from Irish meteorological weather stations. The project explores seasonal, regional, and long-term trends in sunshine hours and discusses their implications for renewable energy, particularly solar power.

The analysis was completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics module.

# Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from data.gov.ie and contains monthly sunshine statistics for multiple weather stations across Ireland, including:
- Total Sunshine Hours per month
- Most Sunshine Hours in a Day
- Weather station location (latitude and longitude)

# Project Objectives
- Load and clean real-world weather data
- Explore sunshine patterns by station, month, and year
- Visualise trends using plots and heatmaps
- Analyse long-term sunshine trends using regression analysis
- Discuss implications for solar energy and climate analysis

# Requirements to Run the Code
To run the notebook locally, ensure you have:
- Python 3.12.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Install required libraries using:
- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Run:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb)
3. Ensure the CSV dataset is in the same directory
4. Run the notebook from top to bottom

The notebook is saved with outputs already generated for easy review.

# Analysis Findings
The findings highlight strong seasonal sunshine patterns, regional differences across Ireland, and relatively stable long-term sunshine trends, supporting the role of solar energy as part of a mixed renewable energy strategy.

# Resources
All specific resources used are cited as comments / markdown at the bottom of the assignment file / notebook.
