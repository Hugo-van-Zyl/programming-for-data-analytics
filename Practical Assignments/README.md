# Programming for Data Analytics
by Hugo van Zyl

## Overview
This repository contains four programming assignments covering fundamental data analytics concepts. 
The repository structure contains the following files:
- assignment_6_Weather.ipynb
- assignment02-bankholdiays.ipynb
- assignment03-pie.ipynb
- assignment05-population.ipynb
- people-1000.csv

## Requirements
To execute the code for each assignment, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

You can utilize an appropriate Python IDE like VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks (through Anaconda suite) to run this code. Note there is no user input in these assignments, therefore each code block in the ipynb notebook can be run from top to bottom.
